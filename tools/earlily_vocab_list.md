*Note: This list combines vocabulary from research-validated sources (MacArthur-Bates CDI) and educational materials designed for toddlers and early learners. Words are organized by category for easy reference when generating AI images.*

*Recommended approach: Start with simpler concrete nouns (animals, food, objects) for younger toddlers, then gradually introduce verbs, descriptors, and abstract concepts as vocabulary grows.*
